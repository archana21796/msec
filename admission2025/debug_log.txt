Meenakshi Sundararajan Engineering College is one of the top engineering colleges in Chennai. The balance between academics, co-curriculars, and personal development is impressive. I truly value the culture of respect and discipline nurtured here. In my college, teachers were highly qualified and well trained. They were very kind and highly helpful for students in all kinds of need. Professors and HOD were very kind, and they motivated you to score a lot of marks in the semester exam as well as the internal exam.
